    <p>Good morning,</p>
    <p>
      As of today a new Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been put into
      effect. This policy outlines how you can connect to our wifi networks,
      which networks you can connect to, and what devices you can and cannot
      bring with you to work for security reasons. This includes how to include
      your emails onto your own devices. Please download, review, and sign this
      policy before the weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for getting this done quickly and let me know if you have any
      questions.
